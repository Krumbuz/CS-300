Project Artifacts
Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis

Project Two: Working Course List Sorter (Alphanumeric Order)

Reflection
What was the problem that you were trying to solve in the projects of this course?
In Project One, I explored runtime and memory usage of some different data structures. In Project Two, I developed a program to load and sort a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

How did you go about solving it?
I compared different data structures like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. I chose the binary search tree as it provided searching in an efficient manner and ordering for course listings automatically.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered?
Whenever I faced roadblocks like prerequisite checking and input errors, I broke the problem into components, tested each function separately, and used documentation to debug.

How has working on this project expanded your process for designing software and coding programs?
It gave me the need to select the appropriate data structure as far as functionality and performance go. Now, I factor in scalability and the impact that the data structure has on the potential growth later down the line.

How has your experience working on this project changed the way you code maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs?
I was more efficient in structuring my code, utilizing modular functions more effectively and commenting where necessary. This is helpful when revising or expanding programs in the future.
